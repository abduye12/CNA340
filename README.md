The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing depand on the weather 
when you enter the how hot is the weather in number it will tell you squirrels is playing if not boolean True or False

The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive). Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. Given an int temperature and a boolean is_summer, return True if the squirrels play and False otherwise.

squirrel_play(70, False) → True
squirrel_play(95, False) → False
squirrel_play(95, True) → True

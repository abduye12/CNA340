# Project Title pyhton 
The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing depand on the weather 
when you enter the how hot is the weather in number it will tell you squirrels is playing if not boolean True or False

The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive). Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. Given an int temperature and a boolean is_summer, return True if the squirrels play and False otherwise.

This project introduces a simple Python code that uses the turtle module to draw a diagram.The project aims to teach you where to 
to place in the appropriate places.

squirrel_play(70, False) → True
squirrel_play(95, False) → False

## Running
when you enter the number of degree fahreanheit you will see summer or other 

def squirrel_play(temp, is_summer):
 def alarm_clock(day, vacation):

    weekend = "06"
    weekdays = "12345"
    if vacation:
        if str(day) in weekend:
            return "off"
        else:
            return "10:00"
    else:
        if str(day) in weekend:
            return "10:00"
        else:
            return "7:00"


#####ef squirrel_play(temp, is_summer):
   return temp in range(60, 101 if is_summer else 91)

def near_ten(num):

           a = num % 10
           if  (10 - (10-a)) <= 2 or (10 - a) <= 2:
                return True
           else:
                   return False

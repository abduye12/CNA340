## Getting Started
Hi In this project you will use loops to create a racing turtle game and draw a race track.and the lab we are going to work step by step through the problem of racing turtles. The idea is that we want to create two or more turtles and have them race across the screen from left to right. The turtle that goes the farthest is the winner.

There are several different, and equally plausible, solutions to this problem. Let’s look at what needs to be done, and then look at some of the options for the solution. To start, let’s think about a solution to the simplest form of the problem, a race between two turtles. We’ll look at more complex races later.

When you are faced with a problem like this in computer science it is often a good idea to find a solution to a simple problem first and then figure out how to make the solution more general.

Here is a possible sequence of steps that we will need to accomplish:

Import the modules we need
Create a screen
Create two turtles
Move the turtles to their starting positions
Send them moving across the screen
Here is the Python code for the first 4 steps above

These instructions will [do something] on your local machine for [development/experimentation/demo]

### Prerequisites
